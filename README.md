A very unsafe and obsecure esolang
## How to use
Every character can be HTML, JS or CSS code. If you write a '<', its succesor will be JavaScript code. If it's '>', it will be CSS.
If it's '=' it will be HTML, and if it's a normal character it will be HTML by itself.
You don't need to write all of the languages seprately. There is a generator (the `shuffle` function) that randomizes how it will flow.
